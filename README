A cplusplus implementation of Depth-fail and Depth-pass stencil shadows done via gpu extrusion. Simply because I was fasinated by how it worked.

Checkout the bump-mapping branch for an implementation of normal mapping from a normal map (the specular component is now also fetched from a distinct texture).

The original lighting modal was realtime blinn-phong.
